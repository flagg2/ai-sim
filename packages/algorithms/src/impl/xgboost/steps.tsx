          For each point, we calculate the gradient of the loss function
          (pseudo-residuals). For binary classification with logistic loss:
        </Paragraph>
        <Expression>
          {"gradient = y - \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\text{prediction}}}"}
        </Expression>
        <Note>
          These gradients tell us how to adjust our predictions to minimize the
          loss function. We also calculate second-order derivatives (Hessians)
          to optimize the learning process.

          A new decision tree is built to optimize the loss function using the
          gradients and Hessians. Let's look at an example decision tree.
        </Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>At each node, XGBoost finds the split that maximizes the gain</li>
          <li>
            The gain includes both the improvement in the loss function and a
            regularization term
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaf values are calculated using both first and second-order
            gradients
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Note>
          In the actual model, each tree grows to a maximum depth of{" "}
          {config.maxDepth} and uses regularization to prevent overfitting.

          The decision boundary shows regions where predictions are positive
          (one class) vs negative (other class). The learning rate of{" "}

          careful updates.
