          For each point, we calculate the gradient of the loss function
          (pseudo-residuals). For binary classification with logistic loss:

        <Expression>

        </Expression>
        <Note>
          These gradients tell us how to adjust our predictions to minimize the
          loss function. We also calculate second-order derivatives (Hessians)
          to optimize the learning process.

          A new decision tree is built to optimize the loss function using the
          gradients and Hessians. Let's look at an example decision tree.
        </Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>At each node, XGBoost finds the split that maximizes the gain</li>
          <li>
            The gain includes both the improvement in the loss function and a
            regularization term
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaf values are calculated using both first and second-order
            gradients
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Note>
          In the actual model, each tree grows to a maximum depth of{" "}
          {config.maxDepth} and uses regularization to prevent overfitting.

          We update our predictions using the new tree's output scaled by the

          The decision boundary shows regions where predictions are positive
          (one class) vs negative (other class). The learning rate of{" "}
          {config.learningRate} helps prevent overfitting by making small,
          careful updates.
